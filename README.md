The objective of this project is to conduct a detailed analysis of a dataset related to healthcare and health in Peru during the year 2022. The information comes from medical records covering various periods, health institutions, and diverse health conditions of patients.
The dataset provides a unique opportunity to delve into understanding disease patterns, healthcare behaviors, and health-related trends in the population. With a focus on data exploration, the goal is to extract valuable insights that can contribute to informed decision-making in the health sector.
The project methodology includes loading and cleaning the data, followed by descriptive analysis ranging from the geographical distribution of medical care to exploring the most demanded types of services. Additionally, more advanced analyses are incorporated, such as clustering patients by specific characteristics and identifying temporal patterns in medical care.
